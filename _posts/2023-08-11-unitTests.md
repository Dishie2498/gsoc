description: Maintaining code quality is a cornerstone of software development that not only ensures functionality but also facilitates collaboration and longevity. In this blog post, we'll delve into two essential practices that contribute to robust code: smoke testing and code formatting. These practices not only enhance code reliability but also streamline development processes and foster a healthier codebase.

## Crafting Reliable Foundations with Smoke Testing
Writing code is just the beginning; ensuring that it works as intended is where the real value lies.
Smoke testing, a practice that involves running quick, high-level tests on functions, is a crucial step in this direction.
Here's an exploration of how we've integrated smoke testing into our workflow:
- Function Selection: We began by identifying key functions within our codebase that serve as the backbone of various features.
- Test Suite Creation: For each function, we created a set of smoke tests that encompass essential use cases.
These tests serve as a quick indicator of whether the function is fundamentally working.
- Automation Integration: Our continuous integration (CI) pipeline was updated to include these smoke tests.
This ensures that any changes to the codebase trigger smoke tests automatically, preventing regressions from slipping through.

## Code quality
Consistent code formatting is more than just aesthetics; it enhances readability, reduces errors, and fosters a cohesive codebase.
We've taken the extra step of adopting the popular code formatter, Black, to ensure a consistent style throughout our code.
Here's how we achieved this:
- Adopting Black: We introduced Black, an opinionated code formatter, to our project. It allows us to adhere to a standardized formatting style effortlessly.
- Configuration and Integration: We configured our CI pipeline to automatically check if the code adheres to the Black formatting style.
This enforces code uniformity and minimizes style-related code reviews.
