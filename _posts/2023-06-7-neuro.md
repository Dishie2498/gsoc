description: The original version of the code in use takes brain data as an input. But HOI may be calculated on any system, not just neurological data. Hence, our first step was to write code in a non-neuroscience language so that it can be multi-purpose.

## Features of the PR
Making the code more broad and supporting additional forms of data is the aim of the [first issue](https://github.com/brainets/hoi/pull/4).

### Removed extra dependencies
- We have eliminated dependencies on xarray and frites python package to make the code more concise.
- The codebase has become even more accessible to users now.
  
### Generalised
1. Users can calculate o-information of any system and not just neurons in particular.
2. User-friendly, even for those without coding experience
